## Overview

The **12-Factor Agents** repository focuses on principles for building LLM-powered software that meets production standards. By following these principles, developers can create agents that are reliable, maintainable, and scalable. The repository emphasizes practical applications of the 12-factor methodology tailored for AI and machine learning contexts.

## Principles

The 12-factor methodology consists of a set of best practices that enhance software development and deployment. Here’s how these principles apply to building LLM-powered software:

1. **Codebase**: Maintain a single codebase for your application, ensuring that it can be deployed in various environments.
2. **Dependencies**: Explicitly declare and isolate dependencies to prevent conflicts and ensure consistency across environments.
3. **Config**: Store configuration in the environment, making it easy to change settings without altering the codebase.
4. **Backing Services**: Treat backing services as attached resources, allowing for easy swapping and scaling.
5. **Build, Release, Run**: Separate the build and run stages, enabling smoother deployments and rollbacks.
6. **Processes**: Execute the app as one or more stateless processes, ensuring that any state is stored in a backing service.
7. **Port Binding**: Export services via port binding, allowing your application to run independently of the environment.
8. **Concurrency**: Scale out via the process model, enabling efficient handling of varying loads.
9. **Disposability**: Maximize robustness with fast startup and graceful shutdown procedures.
10. **Dev/Prod Parity**: Keep development, staging, and production environments as similar as possible to reduce surprises during deployment.
11. **Logs**: Treat logs as event streams, making it easier to monitor and analyze application performance.
12. **Admin Processes**: Run administrative or management tasks as one-off processes to maintain separation from regular application processes.

## Getting Started

To get started with **12-Factor Agents**, you will need to set up your environment. Follow the installation instructions below to prepare your system for development.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mohanadsafaa22/12-factor-agents.git
   cd 12-factor-agents
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Ensure you have Python and pip installed. Then run:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Download and Execute the Latest Release**:
   For the latest release, visit [Releases](https://github.com/mohanadsafaa22/12-factor-agents/releases) and download the appropriate file for your system. Follow the instructions provided in the release notes for execution.

## Usage

After installation, you can start using the agents in your projects. The repository includes examples and documentation to help you get started quickly.

### Basic Example

Here’s a simple example of how to initialize an agent:

```python
from agent import Agent

# Create an instance of the agent
my_agent = Agent(config="config.yaml")

# Start the agent
my_agent.run()
```

This code snippet initializes an agent using a configuration file and starts its operation.
